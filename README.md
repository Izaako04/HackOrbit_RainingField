# 🌦️ RainingField: Smart Climate Prediction for Crops 🌱

**RainingField** is an interactive web tool that combines NASA’s historical and satellite data to help make **informed agricultural decisions**.  
Users can **select a geographic area** and obtain **detailed climate predictions** for a chosen time period.  
Based on this data, AgroClima suggests **optimal crop options** for that location.

## 🚀 Project Objective

Empower agricultural planning and climate risk management through:

- 📊 Clear visualization of key weather variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, etc.)  
- 🛰️ Use of NASA Earth observation data to estimate future conditions  
- 🌾 Crop recommendations adapted to expected local climate  
- 🗺️ Interactive map-based area selection

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🗺️ **Draw or select zones** directly on an interactive map  
- 📅 **Choose time ranges** to analyze historical and probabilistic conditions  
- 📈 **Interactive visualizations**: graphs, heat maps, and statistical summaries  
- 🌿 **Crop suggestions** based on expected climate  
- 📥 **Download results** in CSV or JSON formats for further analysis

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project is inspired by the **“Will It Rain On My Parade?”** hackathon challenge, which focuses on using Earth observation data to **anticipate weather conditions** for specific places and times.  
AgroClima adapts this idea to agriculture, helping farmers and planners **optimize production** through climate-based insights.
